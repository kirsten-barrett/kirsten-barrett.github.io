                            <p>One of the most significant improvements was transitioning from a single-page website to a multi-page structure. The new site architecture provided clear, easy-to-follow navigation.</p>

Each of these things fosters empathy and trust with potential clients. This makes them feel more comfortable reaching out and confident that this business can deliver the services they need.</p>

                    <h3>Testing & Launch</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Before launching the site, I conducted rigorous testing:</p>
                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Browser compatibility</b> across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge</li>
                                <li><b>Performance testing</b> using Google Lighthouse, with a focus on improving load times and page speed</li>
                                <li><b>Accessibility checks</b> to meet WCAG standards, ensuring the site was inclusive for all users</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>After thorough testing, the site went live. I also provided the client with training and documentation to manage and update the website independently.</p>

                        <p>The final website achieved all the set goals:</p>
                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Simplified user experience:</b> The multi-page structure made navigation easier, helping users find the information they needed quickly.</li>
                                <li><b>Clear, compelling CTAs:</b> The addition of clear contact options, combined with SEO best practices, resulted in a 30-40% increase in phone calls and form submissions in the first 90 days.</li>
                                <li><b>Built trust:</b> By incorporating real project photos, testimonials, detailed service information, and a professional design, the site effectively built trust with potential customers.</li>
                                <li><b>Responsive design:</b> The website functioned seamlessly across devices, improving the mobile experience and driving engagement.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>By transforming the client's basic one-page site into a user-friendly platform, we not only enhanced their online presence but also set the stage for future business growth. The new website reflected the company's evolving needs while keeping the user at the center of the design process. The owner was thrilled with the outcome, expressing pride in how the website represented their brand. Through close collaboration with the client and a focus on UX best practices, we created a platform that effectively balanced aesthetics and functionality, and it was incredibly rewarding to see how proud the owner was of their new digital presence.</p>
