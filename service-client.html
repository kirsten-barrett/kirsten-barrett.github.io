                    <br>
                    <p>The goal was to create a user-friendly platform targeted to local users who may be experiencing an emergency and/or needs quick access to detailed and straight-forward information about mold and how to schedule remediation services.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also created a landing page campaign in collaboration with SEO researchers and content writers to further target local audiences by use of optimized content and SEO best practices.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>I chose WordPress with an Elementor theme for its flexibility and ease of use. This ensured that the client could manage their website in the future without needing extensive technical knowledge.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Development involved:</p>
                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="bold">Performance optimization:</span> Image compression, CSS/JS minification, and lazy loading for fast load times</li>
                                <li><span class="bold">SEO improvements:</span> On-page SEO techniques like meta descriptions, optimized titles, quality content, and schema markup</li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Mobile responsiveness:</span> Ensuring that the site delivered a consistent, fully functional experience across all screen sizes</li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Database storage for form submissions:</span> Capturing and securely storing form data for easy access and management</li>

                    <h3 class="seasons-txt">Testing & Launch</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Before launching the site, I conducted rigorous testing:</p>
                        <div class="list">
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="bold">Browser compatibility</span> across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge</li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Performance testing</span> using Google Lighthouse, with a focus on improving load times and page speed</li>
                                <li><span class="bold">Accessibility checks</span> to meet WCAG standards, ensuring the site was inclusive for all users</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>After thorough testing, the site went live. I also provided the client with training and documentation to manage and update the website independently.</p>

                                <li><span class="bold">Built trust:</span> By incorporating real project photos, testimonials, detailed service information, and a professional design, the site effectively built trust with potential customers.</li>

                <br>
                <p>By transforming the client's basic one-page site into a user-friendly platform, we not only enhanced their online presence but also set the stage for future business growth. The new website reflected the company's evolving needs while keeping the user at the center of the design process. The owner was thrilled with the outcome, expressing pride in how the website represented their brand. Through close collaboration with the client and a focus on UX best practices, we created a platform that effectively balanced aesthetics and functionality, and it was incredibly rewarding to see how proud the owner was of their new digital presence.</p>
