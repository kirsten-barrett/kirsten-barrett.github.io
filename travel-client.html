                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>I led the development of a new website for a client who had recently rebranded and needed a fresh online presence to reflect their updated identity. The key objectives were to create a visually appealing platform that could prominently feature their photography while also providing extensive information to potential customers. Working closely with the client’s designer, I translated creative concepts into a functional and user-friendly website that not only enhanced their brand visibility but also simplified the user journey.</p>

                    <p>My first step was to fully understand the client's goals for their rebrand and how they wanted their new website to communicate their updated identity. Through several discussions with the client and their designer, I gained insight into the target audience and what actions they wanted users to take—whether it was learning more about their services or getting in touch.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since the client had a large volume of important information to share, it was crucial to structure the content in a way that would not overwhelm users. I designed a clear information architecture, organizing content into well-defined sections that allowed users to easily navigate between key areas such as services, testimonials, and contact information. I also incorporated collapsible sections and interactive elements to manage the display of information without cluttering the design.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>For this project, I selected a flexible CMS that would allow the client to easily update their content, including their photography and blog posts. I integrated WordPress for its ease of use and scalability, ensuring the client could manage future updates independently. For the front-end, I used a combination of custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fully realize the design's interactive features.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since many of the client's potential customers would be visiting the site on mobile devices, I adopted a mobile-first approach. Using responsive design principles, I made sure that the photography and information displayed beautifully across all screen sizes. This included careful consideration of image scaling, menu behavior, and text legibility on smaller screens.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Throughout development, I optimized the website for performance and SEO. This involved compressing image files without compromising quality, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and implementing on-page SEO practices. I also set up meta tags and structured data to ensure search engines would effectively crawl the new site, improving the client's visibility.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to launch, I rigorously tested the site for compatibility across different browsers and devices. I also performed usability tests to ensure that the content flow was intuitive and that the design elements worked as expected. Feedback from the client was incorporated into the final adjustments before the website went live.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>The end result was a beautifully designed and highly functional website that reflected the client's rebranded identity and effectively showcased their photography and range of opportunities. The platform provided a perfect balance between visual appeal and ease of use, allowing potential customers to explore the client's services without feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information. By collaborating closely with both the client and their designer, we created a digital experience that not only enhanced the brand but also provided a scalable foundation for future growth. This project resulted in an increase in scheduled introductory meetings by roughly 20% in the first 90 days.</p>
