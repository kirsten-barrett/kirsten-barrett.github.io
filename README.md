Developer/Designer Portfolio Website
========================


Description
------------

This website showcases my recent work. After several iterations, I created a clean, resume-inspired layout focused on clarity and professionalism, with more improvements to come.

This website was designed by myself and built with Visual Studio Code utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks or templates.
